Recieved Performance test on March 13.

March 13:
Read over Test and did research into Meteor as I had no experience using it at that point.
Hours of work: .5

March 14: 
Installed Meteor. This took longer than expected, as I ran into an obscure bug
that was causing the installation of meteor via chololaty to hang and not intall
correctly. This was resolved by updating my version of git after finding a post from 
2015 that suggested this solution. 
Hour of work: 1.5

March 15:
I started the Meteor tutorial that was using React and Blaze. As I was following along, 
I realized I would be able to reuse some of the tutorial in the performance test.
This would include some of the CSS used, as well as the Blase user validation and login.
Hours of work: 3

March 16:
I finished the Meteor tutorial.
Hours of work: 1

March 17:
No work was done this day.
Hour of work: 0

March 18:
This was the day I wrote the project. I based the project around the tutorial, using their file 
structure and they boiler plate code to get the project off the ground. My biggest concern when 
starting the project was incorporating the user validation, but because that was handled for me,
developing the rest of the project wasn't too difficult. The section I feel that fell apart was
my implementation of the EditPostControls. I don't believe this is how it should be implemented, 
but because of my lack of exposure to higher quality code examples, I wasn't sure how else to do it. 
I believe with more exposure to React, I would be able to refactor it to something more elegent. 
Hours of Work: 3

Final Thoughts:
This was a basic, yet fun little project. It was good to work with new technologies and to see them
all come together and work seemlessly together and I learned a lot from doing it.
